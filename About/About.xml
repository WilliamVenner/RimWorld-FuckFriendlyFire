	<description>(This mod has no requirements)

Don't you just hate it when a colonist shoots another accidentally?
With this mod, you can change the chance of pawns' and turrets' bullets from hitting each other accidentally.
You can change this in a 0-99% chance in the Mod Settings. 0% disables friendly fire completely.

It can stop bullets from hitting:

* Your colonists
* Your animals
* Friendly factions

It doesn't stop bullets from hitting:

* Enemies
* Anything you specifically target</description>
